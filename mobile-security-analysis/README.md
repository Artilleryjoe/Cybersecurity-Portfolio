# Mobile Security Analysis Tool

This project targets Android applications to uncover static and dynamic security flaws, aligning with Iron Dillo's mission of providing veteran-owned cybersecurity for East Texas small businesses, individuals, and rural operations.

## Scope
Analyze APKs for misconfigurations, insecure data handling, and runtime vulnerabilities.

## Tools
- [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
- APKTool
- Frida
- Python

## Implementation
1. Decompile applications.
2. Write automated analysis scripts.
3. Perform live testing on emulators or devices.

## Usage
Run the Python helper script to decompile an APK with apktool and JADX:

```bash
python analyze_apk.py path/to/app.apk --out output_dir
```

Ensure `apktool` and `jadx` are installed and on your `PATH`.

## Challenges
- Obfuscation
- Anti-debugging techniques
- Code scalability

## Next Steps
- Automate and chain analysis tasks.
- Expand support to iOS.

## Legal Notice
Use this tool only on applications you have explicit permission to analyze. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
