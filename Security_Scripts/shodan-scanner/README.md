# Script: `shodan-scanner.py`

## Purpose
Queries the Shodan API to retrieve information about IP addresses, including open ports, service banners, and known vulnerabilities.

---

##  Features

- Accepts a list of IPs via a text file.
- Uses Shodan API to retrieve metadata, banners, and CVEs.
- Saves structured output to JSON for later parsing.
- Built-in delay to respect Shodan rate limits.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `shodan` library
- `argparse`, `json`, `time`

---

## Usage

```bash
python3 shodan-scanner.py -k YOUR_API_KEY -i targets.txt -o results.json
-k Your Shodan API key.

-i Text file with one IP per line.

-o (Optional) Output JSON file path (default: shodan_output.json)

Example Input: targets.txt

Security Context
This script helps identify:

Misconfigured or exposed services

Known vulnerabilities based on banners and Shodan tags

Attack surface visibility for external assessments

Caution: Use only on infrastructure you own or have explicit permission to test.

Integrations
Use in combination with:

vuln_check.py for CVE matching

markdown_html_gen.py to convert this JSON output into a styled report

 Status
 Production-ready
 Rate-limited by Shodanâ€™s free API tier
 Outputs ready for reporting pipelines
