Security Notes
Purpose: Identifies misconfigured services, exposed ports, and known vulnerabilities for external assessments.
Caution: Only scan infrastructure you own or have explicit permission to test to avoid legal issues.
Rate Limits: The script includes a 1-second delay between API calls to respect Shodanâ€™s free API tier limits.
Integrations
vuln_check.py: Use to further analyze CVEs from the output.
markdown_html_gen.py: Convert the JSON output into styled markdown or HTML reports for presentations.
This script is production-ready and designed for integration into reporting pipelines. Let me know if you need help with the integrations or further customization!
