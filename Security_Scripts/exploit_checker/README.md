# exploit_checker.py

## Purpose

Matches discovered services and versions against a database of known vulnerabilities (CVEs) to identify potential exploits affecting a target.

## Features

- Reads service scan results in JSON format (e.g., from shodan-scanner.py)
- Matches services to known CVEs using a local or extendable vulnerability database
- Outputs a JSON report of vulnerable services with matching CVEs
- Supports output to console or file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

No external dependencies required by default. Customize vulnerability database as needed.

## Usage

```bash
python3 exploit_checker.py -i shodan_results.json -o vuln_report.json
Arguments
-i, --input – JSON input file with service scan data

-o, --output – JSON output file to save vulnerability matches (optional)
```
## Example Input (snippet)
```json
Copy
Edit
{
  "198.51.100.23": {
    "ip": "198.51.100.23",
    "data": [
      {
        "port": 80,
        "product": "Apache httpd",
        "version": "2.4.41"
      },
      {
        "port": 22,
        "product": "OpenSSH",
        "version": "7.4"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
## Example Output (snippet)

    ]
  }
]
```
