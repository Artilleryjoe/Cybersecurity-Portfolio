## Script: `shodan-scanner.py`

**Function:**  
Uses the Shodan API to scan specified hosts for exposed services, open ports, and retrieve service banners.

**Primary Use Cases:**  
- Reconnaissance during vulnerability assessments  
- Identifying potentially exposed IoT/OT systems  
- Validating perimeter security of client infrastructure  

**Key Features:**  
- Takes a list of target IPs  
- Queries Shodan for each and pulls relevant host data  
- Extracts port, banner, and known vulnerability info  
- Output in JSON and Markdown-ready format  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- `shodan` library  
- `argparse`, `json`, and custom output formatting

**Sample Command:**
```bash
python3 shodan-scanner.py -i targets.txt -o results.json

Host: 198.51.100.14
Ports: 22, 80, 443
Banner: Apache 2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Vulns: CVE-2020-11984, CVE-2021-41773
Security Context:
Useful for identifying low-hanging fruit in public-facing infrastructure, ensuring organizations arenâ€™t unknowingly exposing high-risk services.

Cautions:
API usage is rate-limited. Requires valid Shodan API key. Intended only for infrastructure you own or have authorization to scan.

Next Steps:
Integrates well with vuln_check.py and exploit_checker.py for full workflow analysis.
