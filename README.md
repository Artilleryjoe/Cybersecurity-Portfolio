# Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository showcases several small projects for security automation, hardening, and monitoring. It combines Python utilities, Ansible playbooks, and a Kibana-based dashboard for visualizing scan data. More to come.

## Repository Overview

- **Security_Scripts/** – Collection of Python tools for reconnaissance, vulnerability checks, and reporting.
- **ansible-hardening/** – Modular Ansible playbooks to secure servers (SSH, users, firewall, Fail2Ban).
- **security-dashboard/** – Dockerized Elastic Stack project exposing a Kibana security dashboard.

See each directory's README for detailed usage.

## Top Master's Degree Labs

Below are ten standout labs from my cybersecurity master's program:

1. **Active Directory Security** – Hardening and attack simulation in a Windows AD environment.
2. **Incident Response Workflow** – Coordinated triage and forensic analysis on compromised hosts.
3. **Secure Coding Practices** – Remediating OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in sample applications.
4. **Cloud Penetration Testing** – Assessing IAM and network configurations in popular cloud services.
5. **Digital Forensics** – Disk and memory imaging, followed by artifact analysis.
6. **Malware Analysis Fundamentals** – Static and dynamic analysis of real malware samples.
7. **Web Application Attack & Defense** – Hands-on exploitation and patching of vulnerable web apps.
8. **Network Intrusion Detection** – Building and tuning a Snort/Suricata-based IDS lab.
9. **Threat Hunting with SIEM** – Using log data and queries to uncover suspicious activity.
10. **Wireless Security Assessment** – Auditing Wi-Fi networks and implementing mitigation strategies.
