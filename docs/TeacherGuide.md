# Teacher Guide

This guide helps instructors use the cybersecurity portfolio to teach practical security concepts to learners.

## Lesson Plans

### Security Scripts Toolkit
1. **Introduction (10 min)** – Discuss ethical scanning and authorization.
2. **Hands‑On (30 min)** – Run `shodan-scanner.py`, `vuln_check.py`, and `exploit_checker.py` on a controlled lab network.
3. **Review (10 min)** – Summarize findings and map them to potential mitigations.

### SecurityAwarenessApp Modules
1. **Introduction (10 min)** – Highlight the OWASP Mobile Top 10.
2. **Hands‑On (30 min)** – Explore `InsecurePrefsActivity`, `WeakPasswordActivity`, and `InsecureHttpActivity` and then compare with the secure versions.
3. **Review (10 min)** – Facilitate discussion on secure coding practices and user impact.

## Discussion Points
- Why authorization and clear scope are vital before any assessment.
- How small businesses and community organizations can leverage these tools to improve security posture.
- Real‑world consequences of insecure storage, weak authentication, and clear‑text communication.
