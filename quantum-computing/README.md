# Quantum Computing Experiments

This folder explores practical quantum workflows that can benefit small businesses, rural operators, and individuals. The resources document hands-on experiments that translate emerging hardware and runtime services into approachable security capabilities.

## Included Projects

- [QRNG-Based Steganography Experiment](./QRNGSteganography.md) — Demonstrates embedding payloads with quantum random numbers to improve secrecy and unpredictability when sharing sensitive data.
- [QAOA Max-Cut Optimization Tutorial](./QAOAMaxCut.md) — Walks through deploying a Qiskit Runtime workflow that segments graphs with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, highlighting how future quantum accelerators can support infrastructure planning and defense.

## How to Use This Folder

1. Review each experiment write-up for background, setup requirements, and code listings.
2. Follow the guidance to replicate the experiments with IBM Quantum services or local simulators.
3. Adapt the findings to inform cybersecurity strategies for the environments you support.
